# Homemade Mac and Cheese

## Cook the Pasta:
Boil the elbow macaroni (or your chosen pasta) according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

## Make the Cheese Sauce:
In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.
Add flour and whisk to create a roux.
Gradually add milk while whisking to avoid lumps.
Continue cooking until the sauce thickens.
Remove from heat and stir in freshly grated cheddar cheese until smooth.

## Combine Pasta and Sauce:
Mix the cooked pasta with the cheese sauce until well coated.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.

## Bake:
Transfer the mac and cheese mixture to a baking dish.
Top with additional grated cheese and breadcrumbs for a crispy topping.
Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) until bubbly and golden brown on top.

## Serve and Enjoy!
Let it cool slightly before serving.
Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.
